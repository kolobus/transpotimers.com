<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transpotimers-Roberto-TM-ebook/dp/B01GEYJM1I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491234413&sr=8-1&keywords=the+transpotimers" target="_blank" class="btn btn-lg btn-warning">The Transpotimers Book</a>

The transpotimers is a story is about a group of individuals who dared to believe in the impossible and achieved something phenomenal. A story of determination and grit, there is a saying: When life throws you lemons, make lemonade, and this is basically what gave birth to the story of the transpotimers. What makes this book so unique is that it is not just a fantasy writer just feeding readers with impossible and unbelievable stories. It is written by a writer who actually believes that nothing is impossible and is seeking to galvanise readers with like minds to believe that the impossible can be achieved: Time travel is possible for humankind.

The book starts with the story of Cascrypto, a vibrant, vivacious young man whose accident resulting from a moment of stupidity cost him his looks and rendered him only able to walk with the help of a rainbow stick. But instead of sitting down and feeling sorry for himself, he decides to do something about his situation and achieve the impossible, and yes; he did it!

The next chapter is the story of Pondsea, a young man who was desperate for a second chance to fix an incidence in his past that turned him into a pathetic shell of a man. Going back to the past was supposed to be an impossibility, it had never been done before. Mere discussing it in public and people would call you crazy, that was until Roberto and his fellow transpotimers decided to help him fix his life and return him to his usual confident self.

It is a book about breaking conventions and impossibilities, a book about second chances, a book about belief and faith. It contains everything, from moving stories that will bring tears to your eyes, to the humorous ones that will have you bursting out in laughter. The transpotimers is a book about overcoming intellectual and conventional boundaries. If you are a lover of outside-the-box thinking, then you would love this!
